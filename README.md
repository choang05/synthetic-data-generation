By utilizing video game technology practices and Unity 3D engine, we can synthetically generate training data for machine learning applications. For example, instead of the manual task of capturing photos of the physical real life object, we can artificially create photorealistic scenes within Unity and use a 3D model of the real-life object to capture infinite amount of screenshots to be used as training data.

Not only are we able to artificially capture images and automatically label them but utilizing a 3D model's render bounding box, we can project the bounding box to the screen and get information of the region in the image. Therefore, we can automate the process of region labeling providing the basis for object detection.
